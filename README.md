# MasterThesis
In how far are legislators of the European Commission responsive to policy statements submitted by interest groups in public consultations? Traditionally, text scaling methods, such as Wordfish, have been used to answer these kinds of questions, as they allow for detecting latent positions in text based on the statistical analysis of word occurrence patterns. In this thesis, I challenge this approach and propose using text reuse methods for measuring influence in online public consultations instead. I demonstrate that text reuse and document similarity methods are superior for these kinds of research questions due to their capacity to reflect paraphrasing, their independence from policy dimensions, their ability to measure influence on a temporal basis, and the possibility to investigate the relative difference of influence between interest groups. The contribution of this thesis is threefold. First,  I  propose a  novel pipeline for measuring influence using text reuse and document similarity methods. Second, I analyze what kinds of text reuse cases are observable in a case study of a public consultation initiated by the European Commission. Third, I demonstrate empirically that text reuse and document similarity methods outperform the widely adopted Wordfish algorithm for measuring influence in public consultations.  In order to conduct the analysis, a casestudy of the public online consultation of the European Commission regarding the CO2 emissions from vehicles (2007) is used. The replication data was compiled and made available online by Klüver (2009).
